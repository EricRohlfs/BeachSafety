## Technical Challenge

Goal: Calculate Distance between two wireless GPS units.

Steps

Person 1's device

1. Read GPS
2. Send coordinate over wireless

Persons 2's device

1. Recieve GPS coordinates over wireless
2. Read local GPS coordinates
3. Calculate Distance between Person 1 and Person 2
4. Dispaly Visual Representation of distance and direction.

We might need an accelerometer/gyroscope/compass to help with our direction visualization


### Display 

We need a simple durable cost effective display. 

LED's are durable, inexpensive, and easy to wire up.  
Having a screen, like a cell phone, may allow for more features, but screens are more difficult to program, they cost more, and are not as durable.
